# pets-in-space

My app, "Pets in Space", is a digital cemetery for pets. My dog of 13 years just died and I wanted a place to memorialize her. I assume that other pet owners will have the same wish after their own pets die. Former pet owners can post pictures, videos, and a short blurb about their pets who have passed away on one central page.

On the back end, I have included a controllers folder, models folder and routes folder. Please see diagram below:

On the front end, I have included an src folder with three files:

Here is the list of routes:

GET / index / renders a show page of all the pets
POST/ create/ allows users to post pics and blurbs about their pets
PUT/ update/ allows users to edit information about their own pets
PUT/ update / allows an admin to edit information for all pets
DELETE/ allows users to delete their own pets
DELETE / allows admin to delete any pet

User Stories:

As a grieving pet owner, I want to be able to add my beloved pet to a show page filled with other people's beloved pets.

As a grieving pet owner, I want to leave a mark on the internet that represents and celebrates the life of my former pet.

As a grieving pet owner, I would like to join a community of people in a similar situation to myself.

MVP Goals:

This is a communal site where everyday people can go to memorialize their pets. I wanted it to be neat and tidy and have some aesthetic appeal. I wanted to give the owners a sense of pride when posting here. If the owners want to take down their post they can do so at any time, but the administrator has ultimate control over site content. Owners can sign up for their own accounts and log in and out.

Thanks for visiting!
